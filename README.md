This is a fun project to learn [Stimulus](https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). The app itself is a calculator to help solve the research office puzzle from the Game Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. Simply find the X, Y, Z Symbols from the Sticky Notes and select them accordingly and the sequence codes will automatically be calculated. You can give it a try at [Terminus Calculator](https://terminuscalculator.info/).

## How to run the project

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
3. Run `npm run tw:build` to build the Tailwind CSS
4. Open the `index.html` file in the browser

Enjoy!
